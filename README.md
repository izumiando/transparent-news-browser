## The Inspiration
Whenever people ask me, "what are your travel tips for Tokyo?" my answer has always been "always Google restaurants in Japanese." I realized this advice holds true for any information that is influenced by geography or culture; if you want to have a local's perspective you have to look for information in the local language. 

## The Idea
The idea is simple. You do a query search using your own language, and you get news articles on that topic from sources around the world, published in different langauges. You can view the articles in the original langauge and in AI translated format side by side and choose or change your translator tool if you want to fully grasp the nuance that is expressed in the original langauge. 

## Expected Use Cases - inexhaustive, obviously
- Gain a better rounded perspective on global affiars by reading articles about the same topic published in different countries
- Understand the affiliations and perspective of dominant local news sources
- Learn what topics are getting a lot of attention in different regions at a given time

## The Code
I have decided to make this project open-source for the sake of transparency. If you think there are ways to improve this project in terms of efficiency, reducing bias, or anything really, please feel free to reach out or open an issue on this repo.
